Project Title Product Management Application

Description A user-friendly interface for managing products with features like viewing, adding, editing, and deleting products. The application utilizes React, Ant Design for UI components, TypeScript for type safety, and effective state management.

Folder/File Structure and Libraries Used

->src/components: Contains React components for different parts of the application (ProductList, AddProductForm, etc.).

->src/pages: Each page of the application (ProductListPage, AddProductPage) has its own file.

->src/services: Includes functions for interacting with the product data (CRUD operations).

->src/types: TypeScript type definitions used throughout the application.

->src/App.js: Main entry point for the application where routing and top-level components are defined.

->src/index.js: Renders the root component into the DOM.

Libraries Used:

->React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

->Ant Design: UI library providing pre-built components and styles.

->TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript providing static typing.

->React Router: For client-side routing within the application.

->State Management Library (Redux/Context API): Chosen for managing application state. Additional Notes

->State Management: Utilize React Context API or a state management library like Redux for centralized state control.

->Responsive Design: Ensure the application layout is responsive using CSS media queries or responsive design techniques.

->Form Validation: Use libraries like Formik or custom validation logic to ensure complete and correct form submissions.

->Error Handling: Implement error handling for API requests and user input to provide a smooth user experience.

->Pagination and Sorting: Implement advanced features like pagination and sorting for efficient product management.

->Styling and Theming: Customize Ant Design components to match a specific branding or theme. Known Issues & Future Improvements

->Future improvements might include integrating backend APIs for data persistence, implementing user authentication, and enhancing the UI with animations and transitions.

->Known issues could include bugs related to state synchronization or edge cases in form validation. Folder/File Structure
